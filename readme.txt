Let customers subscribe to out-of-stock product notifications and automatically email them when items are back in stock.

== Description ==

In-Stock Notifier for WooCommerce adds a subscription form to out-of-stock products so customers can leave their email and get notified when the product is restocked. Emails are sent using WooCommerce's email template so they match your store's design.

=== Key Features ===
1. Subscription form on out-of-stock products — works with simple, variable, grouped, and external products.
2. Variable products: form shows/hides automatically when selecting out-of-stock variations.
3. Notifications sent via WooCommerce email templates — same look as your order emails.
4. Email settings (subject, heading, on/off) under WooCommerce > Settings > Emails.
5. Batch sending via Action Scheduler — handles thousands of subscribers without slowing down.
6. Detects stock changes from admin, REST API, CLI, and ERP systems.
7. Admin dashboard with stats and a manual "Send Notifications" button per product.
8. Subscription list with search, filters, pagination, and bulk actions.
9. One-click unsubscribe link in every email.
10. Optional GDPR checkbox, honeypot spam protection, and rate limiting.
11. Shortcode `[bisn_form]` for custom placement.
12. Activity logging via WooCommerce logger.

=== How It Works ===
1. Customer visits an out-of-stock product and enters their email.
2. When the product comes back in stock, the plugin picks it up via WooCommerce hooks.
3. Emails are queued and sent in batches — each one includes the product image, a "Shop Now" button, and an unsubscribe link.
4. Custom hook available for CDN/Varnish cache purging if needed.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `in-stock-notifier-for-woocommerce` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **WooCommerce > In-Stock Notifier** to configure.
4. Optionally adjust the email under **WooCommerce > Settings > Emails > Back In Stock**.

== Configuration ==

=== Form Placement ===
- The form shows automatically on out-of-stock product pages.
- To place it yourself, disable auto-placement in settings and use `[bisn_form]` or `[bisn_form product_id="123"]`.

=== Email Template ===
- Uses WooCommerce's email system — same header, footer, and colours as your other store emails.
- Customise subject and heading under WooCommerce > Settings > Emails > Back In Stock.
- Override the template by copying `templates/emails/back-in-stock.php` to your theme's `woocommerce/emails/` folder.

=== Batch Sending ===
- Configurable batch size (default 50) and throttle between emails.
- If there are more subscribers than one batch, the next batch runs 60 seconds later.
- For low-traffic sites, set up a real system cron for reliable scheduling.

=== Hooks & Filters ===
Developers can extend the plugin:

* `instock_notifier_form_html` / `instock_notifier_form_fields` / `instock_notifier_form_heading_text`
* `instock_notifier_before_subscription` / `instock_notifier_after_subscription`
* `instock_notifier_validate_subscription`
* `instock_notifier_before_notification_sent` / `instock_notifier_after_notification_sent` / `instock_notifier_after_batch_sent`
* `instock_notifier_stock_status_triggers` — customise which statuses trigger notifications (default: instock, onbackorder)
* `instock_notifier_cache_purge_product` — fire custom cache purge logic (e.g. Varnish, CDN)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with variable products? =
Yes. The form appears when a customer selects an out-of-stock variation. The specific variation is tracked so the notification only sends when that variation is back.

= Does it pick up stock changes from the REST API or ERPs? =
Yes. It hooks into WooCommerce's core stock events which fire regardless of how stock is updated.

= Which email providers does it work with? =
Any. It sends through WooCommerce's email system which uses `wp_mail()` — works with SMTP plugins, Amazon SES, SendGrid, etc.

= Do emails match my store's design? =
Yes. They use WooCommerce's email template — same header, footer, and styling as order emails.

= Can I send notifications manually? =
Yes. The Dashboard tab has a "Send Notifications" button next to each product.

= How do customers unsubscribe? =
Every email has a one-click unsubscribe link. No login needed.

= What if the product sells out again before all emails go out? =
The sender checks stock before each batch. If the product is out of stock again, remaining emails are skipped.

= Does it handle cached pages? =
WooCommerce and popular caching plugins already purge product pages when stock changes. The plugin also fires an `instock_notifier_cache_purge_product` hook if you need custom purge logic (e.g. Varnish or a CDN).
